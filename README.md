### Reviesed 10/31/22. Editing completed. Bug fixes such as improper instances, variables, and method calls have been removed.

## Ticket Report.

Ticket report is a SQL data based report system written in java to be utilized by Minecraft servers. However, the principles could be applied to other administrative functions and services. It should be noted that this is *NOT* a compiled resource and must be implemented at your own leisure into your own project. Some of the method calls are old and improperly named, but everything that's required to run should work outside of the box. The last version that this was tested on was 1.8.9, however most database systems should not have changed since that and any previous schemes should be valid. Please note that you will need to supply the code with a working SQL database. This can be done either through configuraation file. Please note that this was designed to run using (Spigot MC's)[https://spigot.org] server software, however, most of the principles should be applicaple to craftbukkit or Paper. 

Feel free to contact me with any questions.The individual code it self has some documentation, however, it will need a little more work to complete everything.
